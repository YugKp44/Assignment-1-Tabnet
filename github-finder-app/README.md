## Local Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YugKp44/Assignment-1-Tabnet](https://github.com/YugKp44/Assignment-1-Tabnet.git)
cd Assignment-1-Tabnet/github-finder-app
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables:**

   You need a GitHub Personal Access Token to avoid API rate-limiting, especially for the search suggestions feature.

   - Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the `github-finder-app` directory.
   - Add your GitHub token to this file:

     ```
     VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
     ```
   - *You can generate a token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). No special permissions are required.*

**4. Start the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Architectural Decisions & Assumptions

* **Redux for State Management:** I chose Redux Toolkit to manage the global state (like user search results and profile data). This provides a single source of truth and avoids prop-drilling, making the application more scalable and easier to debug.

* **Debounced Suggestions:** To provide a better user experience and optimize performance, the search suggestions are fetched using a debounced function. This ensures the GitHub API is not called on every keystroke, only when the user pauses typing.

* **API Calls in Component vs. Redux:** While the main search and profile data are fetched via Redux Thunks for architectural consistency, the live search suggestions are fetched directly in the component. This was a pragmatic choice to encapsulate the suggestion logic within a local custom hook (`useUserSuggestions`), demonstrating an understanding of both local and global state management patterns.
